- Enchance DHCP clientid decoding, see also https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2132.txt section 9.14
  - character 1 = 0, then hostname (free text)
  - character 1 = arp hardware types, hardware details

- Carefully, remove all 'use byte' statements

- Do something with chaddr padding, not sure what

- Create something like Net::DHCP::Options::Sort, wherein the insanity of sorting options for picky clients can reside

- Get more packet captures of real life DHCP options (and broken clients) so we can add tests for them

I have captures for these, so these just need keen fingers and minds:

- option 82, agent details decoding

- option 90, auth decoding

- option 120, sip server decoding

- cable and packetcable decoding (inc clientid and option 122)

- benchmarking tests

- fuzzing tests

- Anything you like!
