=head1 NAME

Net::DHCP::Packet::OrderOptions - Option ordering for Net::DHCP::Packet

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Net::DHCP::Packet::OrderOptions qw( :all );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides sorting for optons in Net::DHCP::Packet.

This module is not particularly useful on its own.

Because DHCP clients generally suck, the order of options in the dhcp
packet actually matter. This module keeps the handling of all that
quirky madness in one place

=head1 QUIRK WORK-AROUNDS

Cable vendors really want option 82 to always be last.

Intel PXE really wants option 60 before option 43.

Minimum frame size is 300, but we only warn (carp) if its not.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item optionsorder ( )

TODO This will rearrange the order of options to accomidate as many
quirky cliens as possible.
